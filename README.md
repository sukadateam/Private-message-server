# Private-message-server
<br> Created By Brandon R.

# Purpose
<br> Used to talk to friends without any evidence of chats. After a certain key phrase is sent, the host will terminate all users and self destruct and attempt to format the partition it resides on.

# Where is the host file?
<br> For my own security, the host file will not be uploaded as, it may open up vulnerabilties and cause trouble with law enforcment(depends on what was talked). I didn't start this project for fun, more for self protection. Encryption methods will be later added(probs 256 bit) for even more security.

# Can I get a copy of the host file?
<br> Personal meet ups are required. The host file will be encrypted and converted to c++. Send me a pm.

# How long will it take to finish?
<br> In my own opion, it will take a few years.

# Will the project ever be fully release(including the host file)?
<br> Yes, I will eventually release the source code for all the files.
